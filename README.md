Hey there! This is my personal website. I plan to have it be a work in progress forever, where I just add to the site whenever I get the chance to. Feel free to HMU with any suggestions or ideas on how to improve the site, and I'll add it to my ever growing list of possible future features to implement later.

**Currently working on:** Better project descriptions & overall site look

#### To-Do List
* Mobile-friendly version of website
* Pop-up images when clicked on

#### Possible Future Features
* Custom favicon
* Music player? (Unlikely)
