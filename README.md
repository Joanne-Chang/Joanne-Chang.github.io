Hey there! This is my personal website. I plan to have it be a work in progress forever, where I just add to the site 
whenever I get the chance to. Feel free to HMU with any suggestions or ideas on how to improve the site, and I'll add 
it to my ever growing list of possible future features to implement later.

**Currently working on:** Better project descriptions & overall site look

#### To-Do List
* Pop-up images when clicked on
* Put tabs under Hamburger icon for small screens

#### Possible Future Features
* Music player? (Unlikely)
