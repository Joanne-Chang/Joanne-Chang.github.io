Hey there! This is my personal website. It is a work in progress forever, where I just add to the site whenever I get the chance to.

#### To-Do List
* **REVAMP THE ENTIRE SITE**
* Sections to add (maybe) / redo -> Retro Manila folder tabs(?): Home, About Me, Projects, Work Exp., Resume
* "Home": (Idk)
* "About Me": My pets, Video game stats + gifs, DIY/Crafts (maybe..)
* "Projects" -> "Hackathons", "GameDev", "Mobile Apps", "Research"
* "Work Exp.": 2 sections for now..
* Hidden page(s): "Game Stats"
* Possible conversion / hiding of tabs under hamburger icon for small screens
