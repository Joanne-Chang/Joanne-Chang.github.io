          <p class="projectDescription">
            <em>Delivering Consequences</em> is a top-down 2D role-playing game where you control a former supervillain and 
            explore a village that you once destroyed. Unlock the game's lore and rebuild your lost power by having 
            conversations with the various NPCs in the village! This game was created in Unity using C#. More information 
            about this project can be found 
            <a href="https://github.com/thenintendodude/Delivering-Consequences-Game" class="projectLink">here</a>.

          <h2 class="projectSubtitle">My role in the project</h2>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            I was the designated "Animation and Visuals" developer and "Press Kit and Trailer" person for this game. 
            For the latter role, I was the one who wrote the linked README above and created a short trailer video for the game (also available 
            in the README). The "Animation and Visuals" role was my main role and where I did software development for the game, however.
          </p>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            The core code-related task that my role entailed was to figure out a way to animated all the NPCs and the player character 
            in this game. For this, I wrote two different animation scripts that utilized each character's "walk cycle" sprites so that 
            the character would appear to be facing the appropriate way when moving in a certain direction. The player character's movement 
            is based on keyboard inputs (arrow keys), while the NPCs have randomized movement.
          </p>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            My other main code-related task was to collaborate with the "Physics" developer of the game to figure out which visual objects the 
            characters should not be able to walk over, including in-game buildings and other characters, and to code boundaries around said objects. 
          </p>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            A more in-depth explanation of my overall role in this project is available

            under the "Animation and Visuals" section.
