          <p class="projectDescription">
            <em>Aggie Dish</em> is a mobile app that provides info about the menus at various on-campus eateries. This app lets 
            users plan when and where to eat at on-campus and to check whether the available eateries have food that fit any 
            dietary preferences or exclude specific allergens. A brief explanation and demo video as presented by my Senior 
            Design team is available <a href="https://youtu.be/paa2Acjiuv0" class="projectLink">here</a>.

          <p class="projectDescription">
            During my last 6 months at UC Davis, I worked on developing this iOS mobile application from the ground up for my Senior 
            Design class. This was definitely the longest lasting and largest school project that I have ever worked on. As such, 
            this project is also the project that I am the most proud of at the time of finishing school. My major contributions 
            included early development on the frontend part of the app and later on the server side of the app.
          </p>
          
          <p class="projectDescription">
            During the Winter Quarter of 2020, I initially worked on developing many of the app's screens through XCode storyboard 
            and then later switching them to programmatically created screens. As the project progressed along, I later worked on 
            fixing any visual bugs that people had caught, and then also worked on various parts of the appâ€™s functionality.
          </p>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            Early on in the Spring Quarter of 2020, I was moved from working on the frontend to the backend of this app. For this, 
            I primarily worked on developing and then later fixing the implementation of the Java protocol buffers that are used 
            on the server side of this app. This mainly included working on the various gRPC methods (which are the methods needed 
            in order for the frontend to actually get data from the database), including getting data about a specific eatery, 
            getting data about a list of eateries, and also getting data about a specific meal menu.
