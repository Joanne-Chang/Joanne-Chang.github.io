          <p class="projectDescription">
            The <em>IFTTT to Twitter</em> project was the final project of my Embedded Systems class. 
            The main objective of this project was to convert a CC3200 LaunchPad to an IoT device by using the RESTful API and to use the device in a unique way. 
            Using a television remote control, a user is able to type up alphanumeric text messages that can be sent through the LaunchPad 
            and posted online under a connected Twitter account.

          <h2 class="projectSubtitle">My role in the project</h2>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            This project consisted of the usage of both hardware and software. 
            For the software aspect of this project, I was in charge of setting up the web service that was used to make the LaunchPad an IoT device. 
            As such, I chose to use IFTTT as the web service, with the targetted online location being a Twitter account. Along with setting up 
            the web hooks for IFTTT to Twitter, I also wrote C code using the RESTful API to connect the LaunchPad to the school's wifi. 
            This code was then uploaded onto the flash memory of the LaunchPad.
          </p>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            Meanwhile, for the hardware aspect of this project, I was in charge of physically modifying the CC3200 LaunchPad so that the LaunchPad 
            could actually be used as an IoT device. Referring to lab manuals and doing some circuit calculations, I thus worked on connecting the 
            LaunchPad to a breadboard with an OLED display screen and an IR receiver module, which you can see in the image above. 
          </p>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            So, how does this work? 
            The module is used to convert the IR remote signals sent by the remote control into numeric patterns that C code (which was 
            also written separately and then uploaded to the LaunchPad) can translate into alphanumeric characters. These characters are then 
            sent to the OLED screen to display what had been pressed on the remote control. When the "send" button is selected on the 
            remote control, the message displayed on the OLED screen is sent back to the LaunchPad, which then sends the message over the 
            Internet to the connected Twitter account for posting.
