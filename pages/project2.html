          <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Project Overview</h2>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            The <em>IFTTT to Twitter</em> project was the final project of my Embedded Systems class and utilized several concepts 
            that we had been taught over the course of the quarter. The main objective of this project was to convert a CC3200 
            LaunchPad to an IoT device by using the RESTful API in order to send some message through the LaunchPad to an online 
            location. The only other requirement of this project was to modify the CC3200 LaunchPad in a unique way compared to 
            other projects in the class.

          <h2 class="projectSubtitle">My role in the project</h2>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            With this project, I was given the chance to create a project that combined both hardware and software. Working with 
            a lab partner, we decided that for the core of our project, the web service that we would be using to make our LaunchPad 
            an IoT device would be IFTTT with the targetted online location being a Twitter account. This is the main software part 
            of the project.
          </p>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            For the hardware and "unique" aspect of our project, we chose to use a television remote control to type up alphanumeric 
            text messages that would then be sent through the LaunchPad and posted online under the connected Twitter account. In an 
            image above, you'll see that there are several wires connecting the LaunchPad to a breadboard that has an OLED display 
            screen and an IR receiver module. The module is used to convert the IR remote signals sent by the remote control into 
            numeric patterns that our C code (which is uplaoded to the LaunchPad) can translate into alphanumeric characters. These 
            characters are then sent to the OLED screen to display what had been pressed on the remote control.
          </p>
          <p class="projectDescription">
            When the "send" button is selected on the remote control, the message displayed on the OLED screen is sent back to the 
            LaunchPad, which then sends the message over the Internet to the connected Twitter account for posting. The pictures 
            included above show an example of the custom message "CRUMBLE" being successfully sent over the Internet from the CC3200 
            LaunchPad to a Twitter page by utilizing the IFTTT Internet of Things service.
